>> USE / INSTALL

Because of its BSD license, if you use simclist you can simply embed its whole
source code into your application.
Otherwise, simclist can be installed as a shared library. For installing
SimCList as a shared library:

1. enter the package root directory
2. let cmake (http://cmake.org) produce the Makefile you need (mind the trailing dot)
        $ cmake .
3. compile
        $ make

- perftest/*            sources for performance tests


>> API DOCUMENTATION

Use doxygen to build SimCList's doc. A Doxyfile configuration for doxygen is
already available in the package.
