	Abstract = {Today's reusable robotics software is provided by several self-contained open-source projects with virtually no software reuse between them. Such partitioning leads to problems with software quantity, quality, ease of evaluation and, ultimately, to poor end user experience. By reviewing several of the projects we observe that all of them contain a mix of three types of software: 1) driver and algorithm implementations, 2) communication middleware, and 3) robotic software framework. We show that more than half of the
combined code base contains software which emph{could} be highly reusable but only a small fraction of it actually is.},

	Abstract = {Ice is a new object-oriented middleware platform that allows developers to build distributed client-server applications with minimal effort. While similar in concept to Corba, Ice breaks new ground by providing an object model that is both simpler and more powerful, by getting rid of inefficiencies that plagued middleware in the past, and by providing new features such as user datagram protocol (UDP) support, asynchronous method dispatch, built-in security, automatic object persistence, and interface aggregation. We discuss design decisions, contrasts the Corba and Ice approaches, and outlines the advantages that result from a better design.},

It provides the means for defining and implementing interfaces such that components developed independently are likely to be inter-operable. In addition it provides a repository of free re-useable components. Orca attempts to be widely applicable by imposing minimal design constraints. This Chapter describes lessons learned while using Orca and steps taken to improve the framework based on those lessons. Improvements revolve around middleware issues and the problems encountered while scaling to larger distributed systems. Results are presented from systems that were implemented.},

	Abstract = {This paper gives an overview of component-based software engineering (CBSE), motivates its application to the field of mobile robotics, and proposes a particular component model. CBSE is an approach to system-building that aims to shift the emphasis from programming to composing systems from a mixture of off-the-shelf and custom-built software components. This paper argues that robotics is particularly well-suited for and in need of component-based ideas. Furthermore, now is the right time for their introduction. The paper introduces Orca - an open-source component-based software engineering framework proposed for mobile robotics with an associated repository of free, reusable components for building mobile robotic systems.},

	Abstract = {Player/Stage has become a de facto standard in the open source robotics community. We describe recent work on restructuring the Player robot device server into a system that more closely aligns with the idea of a robot framework. The general requirements for a robot framework are also discussed. Player 2.0 is a major improvement in two basic areas, simplicity and flexibility. The driver API has been vastly simplified with many more parts of the communication being hidden from the user. The flexibility of the new system is realised in  the library division that allows for different transport layers (or no transport at all), and in the new device address structure that allows for inter-server device subscriptions. },
